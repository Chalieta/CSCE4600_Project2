# Project 2: Shell Builtins

## Description

For this project, we added commands to a simple shell.

Two shell builtins have already been added to the package builtins:

- `cd`
- `env`

The commands that we added to the package builtins:

- `mkdir`
- `ls`
- `open`
- `pwd`
- `touch`
- `cat`
- `echo`

## Steps

1. Clone the repository:

   `gh repo clone Chalieta/CSCE4600_Project2`

2. To run, type into commandline:

   `go run .`

3. Test each command by typing it into the commandline.
4. Type `exit` to exit the shell.
